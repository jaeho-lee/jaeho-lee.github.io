I lead [EffL](https://effl.postech.ac.kr), a research group focused on **Efficient ML**.

As an advisor, I try to ...
- keep active members sub-10,
- have weekly meetings with all EffLers (30-60 mins),
- and minimize the students' load for non-academic external projects.

I expect EffLers to
- lead their own research agenda,
- be a top expert in at least one area,
- and share their knowledge with other EffLers
