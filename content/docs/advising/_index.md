I am advising brilliant talents at [EffL@POSTECH](https://effl.postech.ac.kr).

As an advisor, I am commited to these principles:
- keeping the group small,
- having individual weekly meetings (30-60mins at least),
- and keeping non-academic burdens minimal.

I expect EffLers to
- lead their own research agenda patiently,
- gain top-notch expertise in their own area,
- and willingly share their knowledge with fellow EffLers.
