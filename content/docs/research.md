**Long-term Goal.** Making AI more _responsible_: accessible, sustainable, and righteous.


**Current Focus.** Various facets of effcient machine learning.

In particular, I try to answer these questions.
- Given a fixed resource for training and inference, what is the best machine intelligence we can get?
- How can we effectively utilize the data-level redundancy for efficient training?
- How can we replace the noise, inherent in ML, with a compute-efficient option?

**Papers.** See the [group webpage](https://effl.postech.ac.kr/docs/research/papers/).
