My long-term goal is to make AI more _responsible_---accessible, sustainable, and righteous.

Currently, I am focusing on various facets of **Efficient ML**. Together with [EffLers](https://effl.postech.ac.kr), I am striving to enable ML without giant-scale models/data/compute by innovating relevant theories, algorithms, and systems. Some recent research questions that I am specifically interested in are:
- How (and to what extent) can we reduce the data-level redundancy for efficient training?
- How can we replace the _noise_ inherent in ML with a compute-efficient one?

**Publications.** See the [group webpage](https://effl.postech.ac.kr/docs/research/papers/).
