Together with EffLers, I am striving to enable ML without giant-scale models/data/compute by innovating relevant theories, algorithms, and systems. Some recent research questions that I am specifically interested in are:\nHow (and to what extent) can we reduce the data-level redundancy for efficient training? How can we replace the noise inherent in ML with a compute-efficient one? Publications.
